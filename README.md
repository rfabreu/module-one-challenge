# Code Refactor Challenge

## About The Project

The task of this project is to perform a code refactor for the Horiseon website. The purpose of this refactoring is to make the existing code more concise, accessible and optimized. The updates should not alter the page style displayed, and should result in better SEO and accessibility.

### Steps completed:
* Descriptive title was added
* HTML elements replaced with semantic HTML
* Descripitive comments were added to the HTML and CSS documents
* ALT attributes were added to the image elements to improve accessibility
* The CSS document was updated to follow a logical structure
    * Comments were added to identify classes
    * CSS code was shortened when possible to remove redundancy
* Page links were fixed and now work properly

### Links

– [Application deployed at live URL](https://rfabreu.github.io/module-one-challenge/)<br />
– [GitHub code repository](https://github.com/rfabreu/module-one-challenge)

### Installation and Usage

1. Upload index.html, and the assets folder contained in the Develop folder to the hosting server. These folders contain essential material for proper rendering of the website.
2. After uploading, the webpage should be viewed on Desktop browsers, as it is not yet optimized for mobile or small screens usage.

_Below is a screenshot of how the application should look after rendering properly._
